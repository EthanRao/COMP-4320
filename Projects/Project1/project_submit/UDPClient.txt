We are asking all patients to call 334-844-9825 to answer a series of screening questions. Patients�with COVID-19 symptoms do not come inside the clinic. They are seen either outside at our testing site or via a Telehealth appoin�ment.</p></li>									<li><p>Personal Protective Equipment. All staff members that have contact with patients are required to wear at a minimum a face covering. We are following the CDC Guidelin�s on this requirement. If a patient is sick (and we have ruled out COVID-19)�they must wear a face covering before entering the building.</p></li>									<li><p>Physical Distancing. All patients must practice physical distancing while in our clinic, and sit at least 6 feet apart from other patients in the waiting room. Kiosk usage is staggered to gu�rantee physical distancing during check-in.</p></li>			�					<li><p>Staff Monitoring. Staff members' temperatures and symptoms are monitored daily. If a staff member presents with any CO�ID-19 symptoms, they are tested and sent home immediately.</p></li>									<li><p>No Visitors. We are not allowing people to accompany patients to their visits in the Medical Clinic.</p></li>								</ul>															</div>						</div>					</div>					<div class="item">						<a class="btn question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#stude�ts_41" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">							Will Auburn have the capability to test for COVID-19 on campus?						</a>						<div class="collapse" id="students_41">							<div class="answer">								<p>Yes.
