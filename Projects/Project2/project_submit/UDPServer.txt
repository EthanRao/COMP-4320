There are heightened and unpredictable health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Risks include exposure to asymptomatic carriers of the virus, as well as virus transfer through face-to-face communications and sharing spaces with others. In some cases, Auburn may recommend that students seriously consider the full online learning option. Ultimately, the final decision resides with the individual student and their health care provider.</p>																<p>Students who choose to return to campus for fall 2020 but have concerns about an underlying medical condition should contact the Office of Accessibility to discuss their on-campus living or learning environments.

Heath screening will be enabled through Healthcheck, a COVID-19 assessment tool that allows individuals to report COVID-19 health status, symptoms, and exposure. Students are required to complete the screening each day before they come to campus. By responding to a series of screener questions regarding symptoms, the daily health screening provides a ‘pass’ for the student to move around campus (i.e., a green screen indicates the student is cleared to move around campus, whereas a red screen indicates the student should not be on campus). Students who report specific conditions will be instructed to contact the Medical Clinic for evaluation and possible testing.

The benefit of downloading and using the application is that it will help improve tracing efforts to reduce the spread of the virus. Use of the application is voluntary, but strongly encouraged.</p>								<p>All information collected by the STAY SAFE TOGETHER™ platform will be collected and stored in HIPAA-compliant servers.

Every student should make an informed decision on whether to enroll in the online option or take classes in-person. There are heightened and unpredictable health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Risks include exposure to asymptomatic carriers of the virus, as well as virus transfer through face-to-face communications and sharing spaces with others. In some cases, Auburn may recommend that students seriously consider the fully online learning option. Ultimately, the final decision resides with the individual student and their health care provider.</p>								<p>Students who choose to be on-campus for fall 2020 but have concerns about an underlying medical condition should contact the Office of Accessibility to discuss their on-campus living or learning environments.  Students in this category include those who by diagnosis are immunosuppressed or those who, because of a medical treatment plan, including medication, may have a suppressed immune system. Students requesting a modification to their learning or living environment may be required to provide medical documentation that reflect current status, diagnosis, treatment plan and prescribed current medications.</p>							</div>						</div>					</div>					<div class="item">						<a class="btn question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#students_36" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">							What housing options do I have if I am immuno-compromised?						</a>						<div class="collapse" id="students_36">							<div class="answer">								<p>If you have a health condition and need an accommodation to your housing assignment, please contact the Office of Accessibility.</p>							</div>						</div>					</div>					<div class="item">						<a class="btn question" data-toggle="collapse" href="#students_37" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">							Will there still be access to mental health resources this Fall?						</a>						<div class="collapse" id="students_37">							<div class="answer">								<p>Absolutely.

All patients must practice physical distancing while in our clinic, and sit at least 6 feet apart from other patients in the waiting room. Kiosk usage is staggered to guarantee physical distancing during check-in.</p></li>									<li><p>Staff Monitoring. Staff members' temperatures and symptoms are monitored daily.
