## Description
Course Objectives The objective of this course is to introduce the fundamental concepts and principles of computer communication networks, from the primary perspective of the TCP/IP protocol stack framework. The treatment will be mainly qualitative, emphasizing principles of operation and performance results rather the mathematical details of performance modeling and analysis (which is covered in advanced network courses). In order for students to gain a better grasp of the basic concepts and protocols of computer networks, students will reinforce their understanding of these basic concepts through actual network experimentation and implementations. You will gain some hands-on experience in Unix network programming through network design and implementation projects.
